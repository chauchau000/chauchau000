### Hi there, I'm Adrienne. 👋

I'm a software engineer with a background in healthcare. 

Pharmacist 👩🏻‍⚕️ turned developer 🤓. 

A love of problem solving led to a major career shift. 
As a self-proclaimed nerd since high school (read: the ONLY girl at the LAN parties), I've always had an interest in coding. 

Comfortable with Javascript, React, Redux, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, Express, Node. 

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,react,redux,py,flask,postgres,postman,express,nodejs,html,css,git)](https://skillicons.dev)

Fun fact: Passionate about all things Star Wars. In my free, I love baking pizza in my Gozney Roccbox.
